# S3-Boto3-Bucket-Lister
This project is a simple Python script utilizing the Boto3 library to list objects within an AWS S3 bucket. It provides a basic demonstration of how to interact with AWS services programmatically using access key credentials, although best practices would recommend using more secure authentication methods.
